# Geometry to Parameter Mapping based on Neural Networks
This is a draft.

## About the project
This project is part of my project thesis, in which I tried to find a way to find descriptive parameters from a given geometry represented by a point cloud. I wanted to answer the question: it is feasible to solve this problem using Deep Learning Neural Networks? 

I haven't worked with Neural Networks before, but I relatively quickly found out that working with point clouds as input parameters for NN is quite challenging. Some papers I found that adress this challenge are:


- [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf)
- [PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on
Point Sets in a Metric Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02413.pdf)
- [PointCNN: Convolution On X -Transformed Points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07791.pdf)


For programming, I used Tensorflow and Keras. I followed this example of [Point cloud classification with PointNet](https://keras.io/examples/vision/pointnet/) for feeding the point cloud data into my NN.
